#summary A brief introduction to Big Visible Cruise

=Why BVC Was Created=

Big Visible Cruise was created as an alternative (or an addition to) the information radiators that are typically used for continuous integration. While I certainly love Nabaztag (http://www.nabaztag.com/en/index.html), Orbs (http://www.ambientdevices.com/cat/orb/orborder.html), and Lava Lamps (http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/cgi-bin/pragauto.cgi) - I also think there is a place for a simple big screen of information that shows the status of your build or builds.

=What Is BVC?=

BVC simply shows the status of your build at a specific moment in time. It's green (successful), yellow (building), or red (broken or has an exception). BVC will display all of the projects that are at the url that you provide.

=How Hard Is It To Setup And Configure?=

Easy. Very Easy. Copy the distribution from the Downloads page (http://code.google.com/p/bigvisiblecruise/downloads), unzip it, add the url for CCNet, and run !BigVisibleCruise.exe.
