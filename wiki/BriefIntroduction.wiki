#summary A brief introduction to Big Visible Cruise

=What Is BVC?=

BVC simply shows the status of your build at a specific moment in time. It's either green, yellow, or red. BVC will display all of the projects that are at the url that you provide.

BVC has a very simple and informative interface. A new row is added to the screen for each of the projects hosted in Cruise Control. The color of each row indicates the status of the build.

|| *Color* || *Meaning* ||
||Green||Successful Build||
||Yellow||Building||
||Red||Broken Build or Exception||
||White||Unknown (or any other value)||

BVC was intended to run full-screen on a dedicated monitor.

The default BVC setup will point to the CCNet Live site.

=Setting Up BVC=

Setting up the application is easy. Very Easy. Copy the distribution from the Downloads page (http://code.google.com/p/bigvisiblecruise/downloads), unzip it, add the url for the Cruise project xml, and run !BigVisibleCruise.exe.

=Shortcuts=
All the interaction with BVC can be done easily using keyboard shortcuts. There are only a few things that you can do, so these key combos are displayed on the bottom of the screen in very small type.

|| *Shortcut Key* || *Functionality* ||
||F5||Forces a refresh (regardless of poll interval)||
||F11||Toggle Fullscreen Mode||
||F12||Open the options window||

=Configuring BVC=

F12 brings up the configuration...

The options that are available are:

|| *Field* || *Meaning* ||
||Auto Refresh Rate||The frequency that BVC will poll for status (hh:mm:ss)||
||Xml Url||This is the url to the xml status (e.g. http://ccnetlive.thoughtworks.com/ccnet/XmlStatusReport.aspx) ||
||Skin||The view for seeing the current status||

Clicking the save button will apply changes immediately.

=Dependencies For Running BVC=

The Big Visible Cruise display makes use of the REST-style interface exposed from Cruise. All of the recent Cruise builds should support this interface. To see if your Cruise instance exposes this interface, try and browse to ...

 * .CCNet: {{{http://<server>/<ccnet dir>/XmlStatusReport.aspx}}}
 * .rb: {{{http://<server>/<cruise dir>/XmlStatusReport.aspx}}}
 * Cruise (Java): {{{http://<server>/<cruise dir>/xml}}}

You'll also need .Net 3.0 installed.

=Developing For BVC=

The source is provided as a VS2005 solution and uses the WPF Extensions for .Net Framework 3.0. This will be upgraded to 2008 as soon as someone requests it or when I take the time to upgrade to 2008.

If you would like to submit modifications, patches are appreciated.
