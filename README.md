# Big Visible Cruise

##Project Overview
This project provides a "Big Visible Chart" or "Information Radiator" for the various Cruise Control implementations (Java, .Net, .rb).

Big Visible Cruise was created as an alternative (or an addition to) the information radiators that are typically used for continuous integration. While I certainly love Nabaztag, Orbs, and Lava Lamps - there is a place for a simple big screen of information that shows the status of your build or builds.

The sweet spot for BVC is a team room or on a dedicated monitor that is visible to multiple individuals. I'm currently using BVC with CCTray to provide a good visual with good auditory feedback of the build status.
